# Googly Eyes Minion Clock
These are the project files for the Googly Eyes Minion Clock. The design, print, and assembly process is documented on Instructables.

# Project Files

*Models*

These are the 3D model files. Besides the ubiquitous STL files, I included a MeshMixer file that is the source for the rest of the generated files.

* minion.200mm-edited.mix: Original minion, resized to 200mm, eye balls remove, hemispheres hours and minutes added, an split into the front and back. MeshMixer file format.
* minion.200mm-edited-front.*: This is the front half (actually, more than half) of the minion-200mm-edited.mix file. It's in different file formats depending on the workflow stage.
* eye-bracket.*: Bracket to hold the pair of steppers. Obviously the size is particular to my steppers. 123d Design file format or the stl file for printing.
* eye.*: Hemispherical eye with a connector to receive the pinion gear on the stepper shaft. 123d Design file format or the stl file for printing.

*Electronics*

These are the Arduino code files that control the clock.
